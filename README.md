About:  Connect four is a test project I made back in 2014 but decided to add it today (2025) to have a URL when I apply to jobs.  If the job search drags, I expected to improve it and also add more repos.
Execute the code:  Open in Visual Studio, select 'Connect Four UI' as the starting project, and hit F5.
